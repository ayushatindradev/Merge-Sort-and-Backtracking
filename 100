    // . What is Merge Sort?
    // Merge sort is a divide and conqure sorting algorithm that recursively splits the array into two halves , sort them seperatly and then merge them back in sorted order.
    // 2. Why is Merge Sort a Divide and Conquer Algorithm?
    // Merge sort follow the divide and conqure strategy becausw :
    // divide : it recursively split the atyyay into two halves.
    // connqure:it sort each half independendly.
    // combime :it marges the two sorted halves back together

// 3. What is the Time Complexity of Merge Sort?
// best Case: o(nlogn)
// average:o(nlogn)
// worst:o(nlogn)
// 4. Why is Merge Sort better than Bubble Sort for large inputs?
// merge sort is o(nlogn) and bubble sort is o(n*n)
// merge sort is much faster for larges input because it reduces the number of comparision significanlty
// it is stable
// (maintains order of equal ) and workd well for linkedlist
// 5. Write a simple Merge Sort function in C++.
// int arr[]={12,11,13,5,6,7};
// int n= sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
// mergesort(arr,0,n-1);
// cout<<"Sorted Arrays: "<<endl;

// for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
//     cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
// }
// // Modify Merge Sort to Sort in Descending Order.
// // . Count the Number of Comparisons in Merge Sort.
// // 10. Find the kth Smallest Element using Merge Sort.
// int k=2;
// findKthElemnet(arr,size,k);
// What is Merge Sort?
// Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that splits an array into smaller parts ,sort them and then merge the sorted parts to produce a fully sorted array.
// How does Merge Sort split an array?
// It divides the array into roughly eaual hlvely eqaula halves until each part has or no element.
// What happens during the merge step in Merge Sort?
// during tge merge sort two sorted subarray are combined into a single sortes array by comparing the elemsnt form each subarray and arranging them in order..
// Why is Merge Sort called a "divide and conquer" algorithm?
// becuase it divides the problem into smaller parts solves each part , then conquere the whole by merging the sorted parts
// .What is recursion and how is it used in Merge Sort?
// recursion is hwne a fiunction calls itself .Inmerge sort then sorting function calls itself to sort each half of the array until the basecondition is met/
// How do you merge two sorted arrays?
// you compare the first element of the both array , move the smaller one to a new and repet untile all element are merges in sorted .
// What is the time complexity of Merge Sort?
// o(nlogn);
// Is Merge Sort a stable sorting algorithm?
// Yes merge sort can be easily impltemnt inc++ to sort array or vector of number.

// Can Merge Sort be used to sort numbers in C++?
// yes merge sort can be easily impletents in c++ to sort array pf vector of number

// What is one advantage of Merge Sort over Bubble Sort?
// merge sort is much fast than bubble sort ,espicially for larger array ,sue array,sue to its o(nlogn) efficiency to bubble sort's o(n^2)
// What is Merge Sort?
// merge sort is sorting algorithm that divides an array into halves sorted sorts each half and then merges the sorted halves to form a fully sorted array.
// How does Merge Sort split an array?
// It recursivley divieds the array into two roughly equal halves unlil each each subarray contains one or zero  element.
// What is the base case in Merge Sort?
// The best case is when the array has one or no elemet meaing it is alrelady sorted.
// What does "divide and conquer" mean in Merge Sort?
// it means breaking the probl,e into smlaaer pieces (dividing),solving each piece indivivuallt (conquring) and then combining them to solve origial problems
// What is the role of the merge function?
// the merge function combines two sorted function subarrays into a single sorted array by comparing and ordering their elements.
// How many levels of recursion does Merge Sort typically have?
// Approximatlt logn levels where n is the number of eklemenst .
// What is the time complexity of Merge Sort?
// O(n log n)
// What extra space does Merge Sort require?
// O(n) for aditinal spaces for temp arrat uses dduring merging.
// // }}
// Is Merge Sort a stable sorting algorithm?
// Yes it preseres the relatives order pf equal of wlemenets.
// How does recursion help in Merge Sort?
// recursion sinplefies the process by automatically handling the repeated spilting of the array until reaching the base case.

// What happens during the merge step?

// two sorted subarrays are combined there elemensts and placing them in order in a new array.
// Can Merge Sort be used with linked lists?
// yes merge sort swors well with linkedlist because it doesnot requere andome access to eleemnts.
// How are two sorted arrays merged?
// by complring the smallesr elemensr of each array ans copping the smaeer one inti a new array.
// What happens if the input array is already sorted?
// merge sort still split and merge the array so its time complexity remains o(nlogn).
// How does Merge Sort handle duplicate values?
// dupliuctes values are treated like any other element sand the algorithm maintains there relative order.

// What is a sorted subarray?
// A sorted subarray us a portion of the array in which the elements are in orderder.
// Is Merge Sort a comparison-based algorithm?
// Yes it sorts ny comparing the elemenst in the array.
// What makes Merge Sort more efficient than Bubble Sort?
//
// Merge sorts o(longn) time complexity in much fatsre than bubble sort's.
// Does Merge Sort modify the original array?

// yes the merge step undates the origianl array with sorted wlwmwnst.
// What is the main operation in the merge process?
// The main operation is compareing the fromt elemenst of two subarrays and copinh the smaller one into the merges array.
// Can Merge Sort be adapted to sort in descending order?
// yes by reversing the cp,parision logic in the merge function.
// What purpose do temporary arrays serve in Merge Sort?
// temp array holds the divided subarray duing merging making it easier to combione them in sorted order.
// How does Merge Sort ensure every element is included in the final array?
// the merging process continues until all the elemnst from the divides subarray have been copied into the sorted order.
//
// Is Merge Sort implemented in-place?
// no , becusase it requere addition space proportion to the size o fthe array o(n).
// What does it mean for a sort to be stable?
// stability means that if two elemesr are qual there original orer is preservedin the sorted output.
// Why is recursion beneficial in Merge Sort implementations?
// recursion simplify code structure by automatically manging subdivion of the array .
// How does Merge Sort reduce the problem size?
// It repeadly spliting smaller parts until each part is trivial to sort

// Why might Merge Sort be chosen for large datasets?
// Its consistes o(nlogn )

//  performance makes it reliable and efficient.}
// What is the primary comparison in the merge process?
// The algorithm compares the frst of the two sorted subarray to decide which one to place next in the merged array.
// can merge sort be impletements using both array and vector in c++;
// yes merge sort can be ompltented for both array and vector in c++ with simpiler logic.
// What is Merge Sort?
// A divide and conqure sorteing algorithm.
// What is the base case in Merge Sort?
// an array is 0 or 1 elemenst.
